		<h2><span class="mechanic-years">44</span> years of practice and counting</h2>
		<p>When I was 6, my father moved our family to America. In time, he taught himself English and opened a shop in Toms River, New Jersey. At just 12 years old, I was already learning the basics of automobile repair work from him.</p>
		<p>Fast forward <span class="mechanic-years">44</span> years, and I'm still using the skills he taught me to diagnose programming-related issues with modern vehicles. Equipped with technology that would make him scratch his head, I'm travelling to shops just like my father's in Pennsylvania and Maryland, offering to save them the headache of sending customers to dealerships for programming work they could have done in-house, and in the process, preserving the trust and business of their clientele.</p>
